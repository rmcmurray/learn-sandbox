# Title

Accelerate High Performance Computing storage with Azure HPC Cache
<!--- Alternate title: Accelerate NFS for HPC storage by using Azure HPC Cache -->

## Role(s)

- administrator
- technology manager
- solution architect
<!--- Optional: functional consultant -->

## Level

- intermediate

## Product(s)

- Azure HPC Cache

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with NFS storage concepts such as mount, export, and namespace.
- Familiarity with networking concepts such as subnet, DNS, and TCP/UDP ports.
- Familiarity with creating virtual machines in the Azure portal.

## Summary

Create a virtual caching solution for NFS storage. Client machines will connect to the cache, read data, and process the data.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module the learner will be able to:
1. Create an Azure HPC Cache.
1. Configure an Azure HPC Cache to accelerate a Linux-based filesystem.
1. Configure (Attach) virtual client machines to read from the cache.
1. Read and process storage data using client machines.

## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *module title*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |

### Overview

Create HPC Cache
Add a storage target to HPC Cache over Express Route
Create HPC clients to mount HPC Cache and request data
HPC Cache reads the data from the storage target and stores it
Client requests for the same data are served from HPC Cache

### Creating the cache

Creating an HPC Cache
Adding a Storage Target
Building the Namespace

### Connecting to On-prem NAS

Express Route highly recommended for best throughput
HPC Cache requires root access to NAS exports
Root squash must be disabled on NAS
Usage Model
Namespace

### Connect clients

Point hundreds of clients to HPC Cache
Most efficient way is to leverage scripts and automation to create and configure HPC clients
HPC clients mount HPC Cache virtual namespace path
Clients must have network access to the HPC Cacheâ€™s virtual network and private subnet
Use the mount command to mount the HPC Cache storage to a local folder

### Configure HPC Cache

NAS Storage Permissions (root access, no root squash)
Network Access (dedicated subnet, DNS, ports)
Client permissions (same vnet, not subnet; network access, NFS utilities, local path for mount)
Mount Instructions
Usage Model
Namespace
